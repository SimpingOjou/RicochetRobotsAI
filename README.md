1) Download all the .py files included in the file
2) Open playboard.py and run the code
   For reasons of understanding the map created:
	i) line 205: def plot(self, pause: float = 0.3, block: bool = False):
	change 0.3 to 120 so as the map will be displayed for more time
	ii) At the end of the code create the board:
	   board= Board()
	   board.plot()
	iii) change the pause to 0.3 again and make board.plot a comment
3) Open ai.py and run the code
4) Open main.py and run the code:
	If you want the visual solutions of the code to be displayed change all 'plotter'= True
	With 'plotter' = True, the amount of time for the code to provide results will be
	significantly more than 'plotter'= False,due to visualization reasons.
